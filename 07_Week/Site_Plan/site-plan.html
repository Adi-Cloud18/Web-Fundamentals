      <h3>Typography</h3>
      <p>
        For this site, I chose fonts that reflect a unique blend of cyberpunk and lofi-cute aesthetics. The heading font, Orbitron, gives a futuristic and digital feel that fits the cyberpunk theme. The paragraph font, Quicksand, is soft and rounded, giving a relaxed, friendly vibe that matches the lofi and cute style. Together, they balance edgy and chill moods perfectly.
    </p>

    <h4>Heading Font: Orbitron</h4>
    <h4>Paragraph Font: Quicksand</h4>
    
    <h3>Normal paragraph example</h3>

    </p>
    
    <h3>Colored paragraph example</h3>
